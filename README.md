# Minimilastic blog page

It's a simple and beginner friendly blog page with the theme of food and recipies. I've made these using simple and core frontend techstack.

TechStacks Used:
                                                        
1. **React (via Vite)** :- Core library for building user interfaces using components. Vite offers lightning-fast development and optimized builds.                        
2. **React Router DOM**:- Enables client-side routing, allowing navigation between blog listings and detail views.                                                          
3. **Tailwind CSS**:- Utility-first CSS framework for styling the app with a clean, responsive design.                                                                 
4. **ShadCN UI**:- A UI component library built on top of Radix UI and Tailwind CSS, used for consistent and accessible UI elements like buttons, modals, and cards. 
5. **Lucide Icons**:-Icon library for modern and customizable icons (e.g., heart, plus, chef hat).                                                                   
6. **localStorage**:-Browser storage API used to persist posts and likes across sessions (no backend required).                                                        
7. **useState, useEffect**:-React hooks for managing component state and lifecycle events like loading posts or syncing with storage.                                                                
8. **Vercel** (Deployment):-Hosting platform for static front-end apps. Handles builds and provides automatic HTTPS and CI/CD integration.           

Features:-
*Homepage*- the homepage contains a simplae and minilistic view.
-> The header part contains a logo of a chefcrown and a name that says 'FoodBlog'. With a small tagline below.
->On the top right corner there'll be a 'new recipe' button, where we will be able to add our own recipie which will be posted in the homepage.
-> The content of the page will contain blog cards, each will consist the recipies and ingredients.

*BlogCard*- The blogcards are represented in card structures.
-> Clean card layout with title, brief description, category badge, and read time.
->Includes a like (heart) icon at the bottom-right corner to mark favorite recipes.
->Clicking a card navigates to the detailed blog post.

*PostCreation*-Modal-based form to create new recipes without navigating away.
->Inputs include Title, Excerpt, Category, and Full Content.
->Automatically generates timestamp and estimated read time.
->Posts are immediately visible on the homepage once created.

*PostDetailView*-Each blog card links to a dedicated post detail page with,
->Full recipe content in a well-structured article layout.

->Buttons at the bottom for:

*Routing*-Uses React Router for clean client-side routing.
->Supports routes:
/ – Homepage with all posts.
/post/:id – Individual post detail view.


DIFFICULTIES FACED AND SOLUTIONS:
1. Setting Up TailwindCSS & ShadCN UI
Challenge: Initially, configuring TailwindCSS along with ShadCN UI in a Vite + React environment was confusing. The documentation for both tools had differences in structure, and there were compatibility concerns.

->Solution: I referred to the official docs and step-by-step guides, ensured all required dependencies were installed correctly (tailwindcss, postcss, autoprefixer), and used npx tailwindcss init -p to generate the configuration files. Once the base was working, I integrated ShadCN components with Tailwind’s utility classes for a consistent design.

2. Persisting Posts and Likes with localStorage
Challenge: Posts and like states were lost on page refresh, which was breaking the core user experience.

->Solution: I built a utility (utils/localstorage.js) to manage all interactions with localStorage. I ensured all create, delete, and like actions synced correctly with the stored data, and loaded the stored data during app initialization using useEffect.

3. Component Reusability and Routing
Challenge: I initially had duplicated logic between the homepage and the detail pages, and managing state across routes was tricky.

->Solution: I modularized the code by creating reusable components like BlogCard, CreatePostModal, and used React Router effectively for route-based rendering. Passing props like onDelete, onToggleLike, and posts helped manage state in a predictable way.

4. UI Layout & Responsiveness
Challenge: Positioning elements like the like icon, and aligning content properly across different screen sizes, was difficult to get perfect.

->Solution: I used Tailwind’s utility classes (absolute, bottom-4, right-4, flex, grid-cols-*, etc.) to fine-tune the layout. The layout now looks clean on both desktop and mobile screens.

5. Versioning and Hosting
Challenge: Understanding how to prepare the app for production and deploy it was slightly overwhelming at first.

->Solution: I used Vercel for deployment, which simplified the hosting process. By pushing the code to a GitHub repository and connecting it to Vercel, the deployment process became seamless.
